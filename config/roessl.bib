  ABSTRACT     = {We present a dense 3D correspondence finding method
that enables spatio-temporally coherent reconstruction of
surface animations from multi-view video data. Given as input
a sequence of shape-from-silhouette volumes of a moving
subject that were reconstructed for each time frame individually,
our method establishes dense surface correspondences
between subsequent shapes independently of surface
discretization. This is achieved in two steps: first, we obtain
sparse correspondences from robust optical features
between adjacent frames. Second, we generate dense correspondences
which serve as map between respective surfaces.
By applying this procedure subsequently to all pairs
of time steps we can trivially align one shape with all others.
Thus, the original input can be reconstructed as a sequence
of meshes with constant connectivity and small tangential
distortion. We exemplify the performance and accuracy of
our method using several synthetic and captured real-world
sequences.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We propose a method to automatically transform mesh animations into
  animation collages, i.e. moving assemblies of shape primitives from
  a database given by an artist. An animation collage is a complete
  reassembly of the original animation in a new abstract visual style
  that imitates the spatio-temporal shape and deformation of the
  input. Our algorithm automatically decomposes input animations into
  plausible approximately rigid segments and fits to each segment one
  shape from the database by means of a spatio-temporal matching
  procedure.  The collage is then animated in compliance with the
  original's shape and motion.  Apart from proposing solutions to a
  number of spatio-temporal alignment problems, this work is an
  interesting add-on to the graphics artist's toolbox with many
  applications in arts, non-photorealistic rendering, and animated
  movie productions.  We exemplify the beauty of animation collages by
  showing results created with our software prototype.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The extraction of iso-surfaces from discrete volume data is an
important and well-studied problem with many applications.
%%
We present a new method for extraction and high-quality rendering
of iso-surfaces which are explicitly represented by quadratic bivariate
splines with interpolating properties.
%%
The approach is based on trivariate quadratic super splines as a
non-discrete volumetric model of the gridded samples. The piecewise
triangular domain of the interpolatory
spline surfaces is determined in terms of an application of the
marching cubes algorithm and an appropriate remeshing.
%%
Our results show that the combination of the spline surface model
with a natural normal field obtained from the volumetric splines
leads to high-quality renderings of these approximative iso-surfaces
suitable for the applications in Computer Graphics.},

  ABSTRACT     = { We present an efficient approach for solving the spherical parameterization 
problem. The essence of the approach is to look for a solution in the 
curvilinear coordinate system, without requiring the additional spherical 
constraints usually needed in cartesian formulations. This setup allows us to 
take full advantage of some existing techniques originally developed for planar 
parameterization. Our results substantiate the efficiency of the method and 
confirm its robustness. Meshes of non-trivial geometry with tens of thousands 
of triangles are processed in a few seconds, always yielding bijective maps. 
This computational achievement bridges a so far wide gap in performance between 
spherical and planar parameterization.},

  Given an initial mapping from the parametric plane onto a surface mesh, we

  The resulting low-distortion parameterization is smooth as it stems from
  solving a quasi-harmonic equation.
  Our parameterization method is robust and independent of (the quality of) the
  initial map.
  In fact, for most cases the methods converges from a simple projection on the
  least squares plane even for complex models.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We present an interactive method for applying deformations to a
  surface mesh while preserving its global shape and local properties.
  Two surface editing scenarios are discussed, which conceptually
  differ in the specification of deformations:
  Either interpolation constraints are imposed explicitly, e.g., by
  dragging a subset of vertices, or, deformation of a reference
  surface is mimicked.

  The contribution of this paper is a novel approach for interpolation
  of local deformations over the manifold and for efficiently
  establishing correspondence to a reference surface from only few
  pairs of markers.
  As a general tool for both scenarios, a harmonic field is
  constructed to guide the interpolation of constraints and to find
  correspondence required for deformation transfer.
  We show that our approach fits nicely in a unified mathematical
  framework, where the same type of linear operator is applied in all
  phases, and how this approach can be used to create an intuitive and
  interactive editing tool.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Recent works in geometric modeling show the advantage of local differential 
coordinates in various surface processing applications. In this paper we review 
recent methods that advocate surface representation via differential 
coordinates as a basis to interactive mesh editing. One of the main challenges 
in editing a mesh is to retain the visual appearance of the surface after 
applying various modifications. The differential coordinates capture the local 
geometric details and therefore are a natural surface representation for 
editing applications. The coordinates are obtained by applying a linear 
operator to the mesh geometry. Given suitable deformation constraints, the mesh 
geometry is reconstructed from the differential representation by solving a 
sparse linear system. The differential coordinates are not rotation-invariant 
and thus their rotation must be explicitly handled in order to retain the 
correct orientation of the surface details. We review two methods for computing 
the local rotations: the first estimates them heuristically using a deformation 
which only preserves the underlying smooth surface, and the second estimates 
the rotations implicitly through a variational representation of the problem.

We show that the linear reconstruction system can be solved fast enough to 
guarantee interactive response time thanks to a precomputed factorization of 
the coefficient matrix. We demonstrate that this approach enables to edit 
complex meshes while retaining the shape of the details in their natural 
orientation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In the last decade, surface mesh parameterization has emerged as a standard 
technique in computer graphics. The ever increasing need for processing large 
and highly detailed data sets fosters the development of ef cient 
parameterization techniques that can capture the geometry of the input meshes 
and produce low distortion planar maps. We present a set of novel techniques 
allowing for low distortion parameterization. In particular, we address one of 
the major shortcomings of linear methods by allowing the parametric 
representation to evolve freely on the plane without any fixed boundary 
vertices. Our method consists of several simple steps, each solving a linear 
problem. Our results exhibit a fair balance between high-quality and 
computational ef ciency.},

the details and are defined by a linear transformation of the mesh vertices. 
This allows the reconstruction of the edited surface by solving a linear system 
that satisfies the reconstruction of the local details in least squares sense. 
Since the differential coordinates are defined in a global coordinate system 
they are not rotation-invariant. To compensate for that, we rotate them to 
agree with the rotation of an approximated local frame. We show that the linear

  ABSTRACT     = {Surface editing operations commonly require geometric details of the surface to 
be preserved as much as possible. We argue that geometric detail is an 
intrinsic property of a surface and that, consequently, surface editing is best 
performed by operating over an intrinsic surface representation. We provide 
such a representation of a surface, based on the Laplacian of the mesh, by 
encoding each vertex relative to its neighborhood. The Laplacian of the mesh is 
enhanced to be invariant to locally linearized rigid transformations and 
scaling. Based on this Laplacian representation, we develop useful editing 
operations: interactive free-form deformation in a region of interest based on 
the transformation of a handle, transfer and mixing of geometric details 
between two surfaces, and transplanting of a partial surface mesh onto another 
surface. The main computation involved in all operations is the solution of a 
sparse linear system, which can be done at interactive rates. We demonstrate 
the effectiveness of our approach in several examples, showing that the editing 
operations change the shape while respecting the structural geometric detail. },

  ABSTRACT     = {We introduce a new technique for estimating the curvature tensor of a 
triangular mesh. The input of the algorithm is only a single triangle equipped 
with its (exact or estimated) vertex normals. This way we get a smooth function 
of the curvature tensor inside each triangle of the mesh. We show that the 
error of the new method is comparable with the error of a cubic fitting 
approach if the incorporated normals are estimated. If the exact normals of the 
underlying surface are available at the vertices, the error drops signifi- 
cantly. We demonstrate the applicability of the new estimation at a rather 
complex data set. },

  ABSTRACT     = {Surface mesh parameterization is a fundamental tool in
 computer graphics, required for applications like e.g. texture mapping,
 remeshing and morphing. Linear parameterization methods are of particular
 interest. Their simplicity, efficiency and robustness, enables the
 processing of detailed, large meshes. In practice, however,
 the current linear schemes are limited to producing (quasi-)conformal
 parameterizations and hence may suffer from considerable distortion e.g.
 in length and area.
 We present a novel approach to effectively reduce parametric
 distortion. Our algorithm is simple, efficient and robust, as it
 requires only the solution of a sparse linear system.
 We smoothly adapt an existing quasi-conformal parameterization with
 respect to different flow quantities such as areas, angles or edge
 lengths. Our adaptive strategy offers a flexible means for
 controlling distortion based on error equidistribution.
 We show how this method can be extended from the planar setting to
 spherical parameterizations, a problem which recently attracted a
 lot of interest.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We propose a new approach to reconstruct nondiscrete models from gridded volume 
samples. As a model, we use quadratic trivariate super splines on a uniform 
tetrahedral partition. We discuss the smoothness and approximation properties 
of our model and compare to alternative piecewise polynomial constructions. We 
observe as a non-standard phenomenon that the derivatives of our splines yield 
optimal approximation order for smooth data, while the theoretical error of the 
values is nearly optimal due to the averaging rules. Our approach enables 
efficient reconstruction and visualization of the data. As the piecewise 
polynomials are of the lowest possible total degree two, we can efficiently 
determine exact ray intersections with an iso-surface for ray-casting. 
Moreover, the optimal approximation properties of the derivatives allow to 
simply sample the necessary gradients directly from the polynomial pieces of 
the splines. Our results confirm the efficiency of the quasi-interpolating 
method and demonstrate high visual quality for rendered isosurfaces.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We present an efficient algorithm for approximating huge general
  volumetric data sets, i.e.~the data is given over arbitrarily shaped
  volumes and consists of up to millions of samples. The method is based
  on cubic trivariate splines, i.e.~piecewise polynomials of total
  degree three defined w.r.t. uniform type-6 tetrahedral partitions of
  the volumetric domain. Similar as in the recent bivariate
  approximation approaches, the splines in three variables
  are automatically determined from the discrete data as a result of a
  two-step method, where local discrete least
  squares polynomial approximations of varying degrees are extended by
  using natural conditions, i.e.the continuity and smoothness properties
  which determine the underlying spline space. The main advantages of
  this approach with linear algorithmic complexity are as follows: no
  tetrahedral partition of the volume data is needed, only small
  linear systems have to be solved, the local variation and
  distribution of the data is automatically adapted,
  Bernstein-B{\'e}zier techniques well-known in Computer Aided
  Geometric Design (CAGD) can be fully exploited, noisy data are
  automatically smoothed. Our numerical examples with huge data sets
  for synthetic data as well as some real-world data confirm the
  efficiency of the methods, show the high quality of the spline
  approximation, and illustrate that the rendered iso-surfaces inherit
  a visual smooth appearance from the volume approximating splines.},

solutions and modifications of pre-existing algorithms are
presented. We apply the approach to a flow data set which,
is both large and topologically complex, and achieve significant

  ABSTRACT     = {Triangle meshes are a flexible and generally accepted boundary
  representation for complex geometric shapes. In addition to their
  geometric qualities and topological simplicity, \emph{intrinsic}
  qualities such as the shape of the triangles, their distribution on
  the surface and the connectivity are essential for many algorithms
  working on them. In this paper we present a flexible and efficient
  remeshing framework that improves these intrinsic properties while
  keeping the mesh geometrically close to the original surface.  We
  use a particle system approach and combine it with an incremental
  connectivity optimization process to trim the mesh towards the
  requirements imposed by the user. The particle system uniformly
  distributes the vertices on the mesh, whereas the connectivity
  optimization is done by means of \emph{Dynamic Connectivity Meshes},
  a combination of local topological operators that lead to a fairly
  regular connectivity. A dynamic skeleton ensures that our approach
  is able to preserve surface features, which are particularly
  important for the visual quality of the mesh.  None of the
  algorithms requires a global parameterization or patch layouting in
  a preprocessing step but uses local parameterizations only. We also
  show how this general framework can be put into practice and sketch
  several application scenarios. In particular we will show how the
  users can adapt the involved algorithms in a way that the resulting
  remesh meets their personal requirements.},

local data samples, such that appropriate smoothness conditions are
automatically satisfied. On each tetrahedron of , the
quasi-interpolating spline is a polynomial of total degree two which
provides several advantages including efficient computation,
evaluation and visualization of the model. We apply Bernstein-B´ezier
techniques well-known in CAGD to compute and evaluate the trivariate
spline and its gradient. With this approach the volume data can be
visualized efficiently e.g. with isosurface raycasting. Along an
arbitrary ray the splines are univariate, piecewise quadratics and
thus the exact intersection for a prescribed isovalue can be easily
determined in an analytic and exact way. Our results confirm the
efficiency of the quasi-interpolating method and demonstrate high
visual quality for rendered isosurfaces.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We propose a divide and conquer algorithm for the single resolution encoding of 
triangle mesh connectivity. Starting from a boundary edge we grow a zig-zag 
strip which divides the mesh into two submeshes which are encoded separately in 
a recursive process. We introduce a novel data structure for triangle mesh 
encoding, a binary tree with positive integer weights assigned to its nodes. 
The length of the initial strip is stored in the root of the binary tree, while 
the encoding of the left and right submesh are stored in the left and right 
subtree, respectively. We find a simple criterion determining which objects of 
this data
structure correspond to triangle meshes. As the algorithm implicitly traverses 
the triangles of the mesh, it can be classified into the family of Edgebreaker 
like encoding schemes. Hence, the compression ratios, both in the form of 
theoretical upper bounds and practical results are similar to the 
Edgebreaker's, while the simplicity and flexibility of the algorithm makes it 
particularly suitable for applications where the connectivity encoding is only 
a small part of the problem at hand.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Remeshing artifacts are a fundamental problem when converting a given
geometry into a triangle mesh. We propose a new remeshing technique
that is sensitive to features. First, the resolution of the mesh is
iteratively adapted by a global restructuring process which
additionally optimizes the connectivity. Then a particle system
approach evenly distributes the vertices across the original
geometry. To exactly find the features we extend this relaxation
procedure by an effective mechanism to attract the vertices to feature
edges. The attracting force is imposed by means of a hierarchical
curvature field and does not require any thresholding parameters to
classify the features. },

  ABSTRACT     = {We present a technique for recovering structural
information from triangular meshes that can then be used for
segmentation, e.g. in reverse engineering applications. In a
preprocessing step, we detect feature regions on the surface by
classifying the vertices according to some discrete curvature
measure. Then we apply a skeletonization algorithm for extracting
feature lines from these regions. To achieve this, we generalize the
concept of morphological operators to unorganized triangle meshes,
providing techniques for noise reduction on the binary feature
classification and for skeletonization. The necessary operations are
easy to implement, robust, and can be executed efficiently on a mesh
data structure.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Triangle meshes are a popular representation of surfaces in computer
  graphics. Our aim is to detect feature on such surfaces.  Feature
  regions distinguish themselves by high curvature. We are using
  discrete curvature analysis on triangle meshes to obtain curvature
  values in every vertex of a mesh. These values are then thresholded
  resulting in a so called binary feature vector. By adapting
  morphological operators to triangle meshes, noise and artifacts can
  be removed from the feature. We introduce an operator that
  determines the skeleton of the feature region. This skeleton can
  then be converted into a graph representing the desired feature.
  Therefore a description of the surface's geometrical characteristics
  is constructed.},

  ABSTRACT     = {While traditional computer aided design (CAD) is mainly based on
piecewise polynomial surface representations, the recent advances in
the efficient handling of polygonal meshes have made available a set
of powerful techniques which enable sophisticated modeling operations
on freeform shapes.  In this tutorial we are going to give a detailed
introduction into the various techniques that have been proposed over
the last years. Those techniques address important issues such as
surface generation from discrete samples (e.g. laser scans) or from
control meshes (ab initio design); complexity control by adjusting the
level of detail of a given 3D-model to the current application or to
the available hardware resources; advanced mesh optimization
techniques that are based on the numerical simulation of physical
material (e.g. membranes or thin plates) and finally the generation
and modification of hierarchical representations which enable
sophisticated multiresolution modeling functionality. },

  ABSTRACT     = {We present an interactive system for computer aided generation of
  line art drawings to illustrate 3D models that are given as
  triangulated surfaces. In a preprocessing step an enhanced 2D view
  of the scene is computed by sampling for every pixel the shading,
  the normal vectors and the principal directions obtained from
  discrete curvature analysis. Then streamlines are traced in the
  2D direction fields and are used to define line strokes. In order to
  reduce noise artifacts the user may interactively select sparse
  reference lines and the system will automatically fill in
  additional strokes. By exploiting the special structure of the
  streamlines an intuitive and simple tone mapping algorithm can be
  derived to generate the final rendering.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In recent years, several techniques have been proposed
       for automatically producing line-art illustrations. In this
       paper a new non photo-realistic rendering scheme for
       triangulated surfaces is presented. In contrast to prior
       approaches with parametric surfaces, there is no global
       parameterization for triangle meshes. So a new approach is made
       to automatically generate a direction field for the strokes.
       Discrete curvature analysis on such meshes allows to estimate
       differential parameters. Lines of curvature are then
       constructed to be used as strokes. Using triangulated surfaces
       allows to render aesthetically pleasing line drawings from a
       huge class of models. Besides, experiments show that even real
       time visualization is possible.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Triangle meshes are a facile and effective representation for
many kinds of surfaces. In order to rate the quality of a surface, the
calculation of geometric curvatures as there are defined for smooth
surfaces is useful and necessary for a variety of applications. We
investigate an approach to locally approximate the first and second
fundamental forms at every (inner) vertex of a triangle mesh. We use
locally isometric divided difference operators, where we compare two
variants of parameterizations (tangent plane and exponential map) by
testing on elementary analytic surfaces.

We further describe a technique for visualizing the resulting curvature
data. A simple median filter is used to effectively filter noise from
the input data. According to application dependent requirements a global or a 
per-vertex local
color coding can be provided. The user may interactively modify the color
transfer function, enabling him or her to visually evaluate the quality of 
triangulated surfaces.},
